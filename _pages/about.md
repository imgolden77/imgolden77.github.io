I'm currently completing an MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Manchester, where Iâ€™ve focused on `Generative AI`, `NLP`, and `Computer vision`. I conducted significant research on `generative models (VAE, transformers)` to spatial omics data for clustering and imputation tasks. My study developed a novel fine-tuning pipeline for state-of-the-art spatial transcriptomics foundation model, CellPLM, reducing training time by up to 300x.

Before entering tech, I worked as a full-time `elementary school teacher` for 5 years, earning a Computer Science undergraduate degree in just two years. This experience shaped my ability to learn fast, stay resilient, and time management. In addition, I got strong interpersonal and communication skills with ability to explain complex concepts clearly and work effectively in `collaborative environments`.

I am eager to apply my strong technical foundation and unique soft skills to impactful roles in Data Science and Machine Learning.

Personally, I like playing `escape room`, going to trip, watching movies, drawing, and playing board games.
