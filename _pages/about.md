I'm currently completing an MSc in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Manchester, where Iâ€™ve focused on unsupervised learning, NLP, and data-intensive applications. 

Before entering tech, I worked as a full-time elementary school teacher, earning a Computer Science degree in just two years, a milestone achieved by less than 20% of students. This experience shaped my ability to learn fast, stay resilient, and build with empathy. I bring these strengths to software engineering, where I value clean code, thoughtful system design, and real-world impact.
