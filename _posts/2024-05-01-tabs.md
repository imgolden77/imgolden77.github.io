This is how a post with [tabs](https://github.com/Ovski4/jekyll-tabs) looks like. Note that the tabs could be used for different purposes, not only for code.

## First tabs

To add tabs, use the following syntax:

{% raw %}

```liquid

Content 1



Content 2

{% endraw %}

With this you can generate visualizations like:

```php
var_dump('hello');
```

```javascript
console.log("hello");
```



```javascript
pputs 'hello'
```

## Another example


```yaml
hello:
  - "whatsup"
  - "hi"
```



```json
{
  "hello": ["whatsup", "hi"]
}
```


## Tabs for something else



Regular text


> A quote
